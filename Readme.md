## TA Matching

This code runs the matchingR [@tillyAlgorithmsMatchingMarkets2018] implementation of the Gale Shapley algorithm [@galeCollegeAdmissionsStability1962] to match teaching assistants with professors and courses. This was being done by hand, and I wanted to help expedite and remove bias from the process. A piece of R code is wrapped within a shell script, which will prompt users to point it towards the appropriate CSV files for matching. These CSV files are generated using a set of Google surveys.
