## TA Matching

This code runs the matchingR (Tilly [2015] 2018) implementation of the Gale Shapley algorithm (Gale and Shapley 1962) to match teaching assistants with professors and courses. This was being done by hand, and I wanted to help expedite and remove bias from the process. A piece of R code is wrapped within a shell script, which will prompt users to point it towards the appropriate CSV files for matching. These CSV files are generated using a set of Google surveys.
